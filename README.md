# ReciPlease App

  There are many applications out on the market that allow users to share their daily life or
work achievements, but a platform purely dedicated to sharing food recipes and instructions. It
is an efficient and easy way for family members and friends to send and share recipes, In
addition to that, members will have access to a timeline that will allow them to explore other
people’s ideas and recipes. An additional functionality will be added for people who do not want
to share their recipes for free. This could mean it is passed down family recipe, or a carefully
cultivated personal recipe. Users will be allowed to make recipes “Premium” and require a
subscription to be able to access them
